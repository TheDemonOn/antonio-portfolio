import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react'

// Thanks to Dan Abramov's explanation and implementation of setInterval in hooks: https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/

export default function useInterval(callback, delay) {
	// First we create the ref which will store the function we want to pass into it.
	const ref = useRef()

	// As is usual with a useRef formula: the .current is set to the value we want to know the value of in between renders.
	useEffect(() => {
		ref.current = callback
	}, [callback])

	// This is where it gets more complicated. I need to understand the whys a bit better to explain it myself.
	useEffect(() => {
		// This function is used to access the previous callback, which is a placeholder for the contents of our setInterval.
		const tick = () => {
			ref.current()
		}
		let id = setInterval(tick, delay)
		return () => {
			clearInterval(id)
